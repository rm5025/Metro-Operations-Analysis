Even though Delhi Metro has a vast network and runs frequent services, overcrowding during peak hours and uneven service distribution still pose major challenges. The goal is to fine-tune operations by adjusting train frequencies and capacities to better match demand at different times and routes. By diving into the available data, we want to find out where tweaking train schedules can really boost service, cut down wait times, and ease the crowding.

The dataset contains several files, as follows:

Agency: Information about the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, including name, URL, and contact details.

Calendar: Service schedules delineating the operation days (weekdays, weekends) and valid dates for these schedules.

Routes: Details of metro routes, including short and long names, type of route, and descriptions.

Shapes: Geographical coordinates of routes, providing the precise paths taken by the metro lines.

Stop Times: Timetables for each trip indicating arrival and departure times at specific stops.

Stops: Locations of metro stops, including latitude and longitude coordinates.

Trips: Information linking trips to routes, including details like trip identifiers and associated route IDs.

For the task of Metro Operations Optimization, I aim to identify the key areas where adjustments in train frequencies could significantly improve the service levels, reduce wait times, and alleviate overcrowding.
